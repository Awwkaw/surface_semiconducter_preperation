# Dispositioner til overflade og halvlederfysik

## Aim
The aim of this repository is to make a good set of papers for understanding the course *Surface and semiconductor physics* at Aarhus university. And doing this by providing both a long-form set of papers on each topic as well as a shorter ''talk card'' style paper for each topic.
## What is missing
The figures for the first to talking papers have been made, last nine talk papers are lacking, and there is no long version of any talk paper
