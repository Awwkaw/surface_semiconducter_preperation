# Dispositioner til overflade og halvlederfysik

##Aim
The aim of this repository is to make a good set of papers for understanding the course *Surface and semiconductor physics* at Aarhus university. And doing this by providing both a long-form set of papers on each topic as well as a shorter ''talk card'' style paper for each topic.
## What is missing
So far only the TeX structure is set up, with a file both for creating a short *one page* talk paper, and a longer, multi page, *book like* structre.
